  <h5 id="tribute-info">The life and the death of Carlos Marighella</h5> 
<p><strong>Carlos Marighella</strong> was a Brazilian Marxist-Leninist communist politician, writer and guerrilla. One of the main organizers of the armed struggle against the Brazilian military dictatorship (1964–1985), Marighella came to be considered the "number one" enemy of the regime. He was co-founder of <em>Ação Libertadora Nacional</em>, a revolutionary organization.</p>
    <p>Son of Italian worker Augusto Marighella and Maria Rita do Nascimento, black and daughter of slaves. He studied Civil Engineering at the Polytechnic School of Bahia, but joined the political militancy and left the college aside. He joined the PCB and opposed Getúlio Vargas's <em>Estado Novo</em>. He was twice arrested and tortured at that time, and on the second occasion he remained in prison for six years. After being released in 1945, he was elected federal deputy by the <em>PCB</em> of Bahia. However, he lost his mandate a year later, when the party was made illegal. He remained to act in the militancy clandestinely.</p>
<p>He always connected with the cultural universe, dialoguing with writers (Jorge Amado and Graciliano Ramos), painters (Cândido Portinari and Spaniard Joan Miró), playwrights (Augusto Boal and Dias Gomes) and filmmakers (Glauber Rocha, Frenchman Jean-Luc Godard and the Italian Luchino Visconti). It is liked by artists and intellectuals of the left. At the same time, Marighella and her ideas pose a threat to many others.</p>
<p>When the military seized power in 1964, Marighella broke with the <em>PCB</em> because the party was defending an unarmed opposition - and that was the opposite of what he was defending. In 1968, he founded the National Liberation Action (ALN), a communist-oriented organization that used urban guerrilla methods - such as assaults, kidnappings and terrorist actions. In partnership with the October 8 Revolutionary Movement (MR-8), he was responsible for the kidnapping of the American ambassador to Brazil, Charles Elbrick. At the time, Marighella became the main enemy of the military, which increased efforts to capture him. He was shot dead after an ambush coordinated by police chief Sérgio Paranhos Fleury.</p>
